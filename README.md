# Homework_5
* ### added parts of code to main.js, style.scss and index.html, always to the end of the code and marked by the comment "homework 5";
* ### js part is described by the corresponding comments;
* ### style.scss and index.html changes are minimal (so that the code works);
* ### after running code works as following:
  * #### after pressing 'time' sequence at the end of the app appears panel;
  * #### on this panel a user can either enter a key word and submit or exit (and start again);
  * #### after submitting the wrong key user can continue to try;
  * #### once the correct key word is submitted ('heslo') timer appears;
  * #### time stays for about 5 secs (due to slower response I had to set timeout for 6 secs);
