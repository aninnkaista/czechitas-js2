# Homework_5
* #### added parts of code to main.js, style.scss and index.html, always to the end of the code and marked by the comment "homework 5";
* #### js part is described by the corresponding comments;
* #### style.scss and index.html changes are minimal (so that the code works);
* #### running app currently looks as following:
  * #### after pressing 'time' sequence a panel appears at the end of the app;
  * #### on this panel a user can either enter a keyword and submit or exit (and start again);
  * #### after submitting a wrong key a user can continue to try;
  * #### once the correct key word is submitted ('heslo') a timer appears;
  * #### ticking timer stays for about 5 secs (due to a slower response I had to set timeout for 6 secs);
